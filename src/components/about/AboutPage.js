        <p>{"After 2 months of intern in Socialtables, I did all kinds of development tasks like adding/updating features and fixing bugs. However, I find that I can't learn more from these tasks, the reason is I am on a large, mature, and complicated company project, everything I do is 'standing on the shoulder of giant, I can modify things but can't build a new one."}</p>
        <p>{"Therefore, I decide to demo a new project from zero, and add thing step by step. during the development, I will contrast the similar features with the 'giant', I believe that will help."}</p>
        <p>{"By the way, the demo of this project is from course <Building Applications with React and Redux> by Cory House on pluralsight.com"}</p>
